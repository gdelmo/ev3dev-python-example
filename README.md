# ev3dev Python example
## How to run this code
Make sure you have the ev3dev device browser extension installed if you are using VSCode.
If you are not using VSCode, I recomend that you use it because of the simpler workflow. However, you can still use SSH to transfer the files to the EV3 and then run them using the "brickrun" command.
